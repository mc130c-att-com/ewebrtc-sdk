# v1.0.0-beta.11
November 26, 2014

* **New Feature:** Firefox Browser Support for Basic Call and Conference Managment .
* **Changed :** Developer should prepend '1' when dialing a 10-digit domestic number (US).

## Known Issues
* Transferring or moving call functionality is not supported for Firefox.
* In a mobile number to mobile number call, transferring or moving the call to a mobile device results in one-way 
audio (DE90397).
* One-way audio when adding a mobile device for a video conference (DE90396).
* `call:move-terminated` event is not fired when successfully completing `phone.move` (DE90395).
* After successfully adding a mobile device to a conference it will be disconnected after ~24s.
  * Related QC Ticket:
    * QC 85425: Call disconnects after 24 seconds when successfully creating a conference (as any user) and adding a PSTN participant.
* Adding multiple participants at once using `Phone.addParticipants` method fails with error: `SVC8501:MediaConference ongoing update participant operation.,Variables=`. SDK is tracking this issue against the API platform with the QC Defect ID: 79678
  * **Workaround:** Use `Phone.addParticipants` with a single participant ID (mobile number, account id, virtual number)
  * Related QC Ticket:
    * QC 85105: SDK_WEBRTC_9.14 - Error: `External server request error.` when adding a participant to a conference created by a VTN user.
* When a participant leaves a conference by using the `endConference` method, the platform does not generate
the necessary event to inform the host. Product Team is tracking this issue with QC Defect ID: 79658
* When a Mobile Number user rejects an invitation for a conference, sometimes the event `conference:ended` will not
  be published due to a bug at the Platform Level (DE90393).
* When adding a participant to a conference, sometimes the error: `The requested conference ID <id> was not found.`
  is shown. SDK is tracking this issue against the API platform with the QC Defect ID: 65423
* Video switching between participants seems to be unstable. Product Team is tracking this issue with QC Defect ID: 79673
  * **Workaround:** Turn off your microphone while the other participant speaks, that will switch the video to the
  speaking participant.

## Tested Environments

   * RESTful API Environment: The SDK was tested against Production.
   * Chrome Version 38 for OSX v10.8.5 and Windows 8
   * Firefox Version 33 for OSX v10.10.1 and Windows 8

**_The SDK may also work for other Operating Systems, other Browsers but is not tested or supported._**

(for usage examples of `ATT.rtc.configure` method, refer to the API Documentation and Tutorial).


## JavaScript SDK for AT&T Enhanced WebRTC API (JS SDK) Beta 1.0

### Bug Fixes

 * Rally DE68721: Camera not disabled on call disconnected.
 * Rally DE81721: Hold, Mute, and Resume won't work.
 * Rally DE68720: Video cam enabled on audio call.
 * Rally DE68929: Reference error for onUserMediaError when local/remote media is invalid.

### New Features

* **Refactored DHS** - Improvements in the organization of the SDK sources for easier use and
comprehension of the different components of the SDK. The new package contains the following components:
  * **Node DHS** - A node application with the following functionality:
    * Manage configuration options for the SDK's Node Sample Application.
    * Manage Application configuration (application key, secret, redirect_uri).
    * Handle AT&T's OAuth Token creation using credentials and scope.
    * Create E911 IDs
  * **Node Sample Application** - A NodeJS web application demonstrating the use of the JS library.
  The Node Sample Application has the following functionality:
    * Manage DHS host and port configuration options for application startup.
    * Provide endpoint for AT&T's OAuth Authorization: `/oauth/authorize`
    * Provide RESTful API to provide configuration for the JS Library:
      * DHS URL
      * Enhanced WebRTC API base URL
      * Enhanced WebRTC domain
    * Provide RESTful API for Basic User Management with file-based persistence.
      * MongoDB is no longer necessary as a dependency. The users are stored in a JSON file. **Once you restart the Node Sample Application all users will be lost.**
    * Hosts a Web application (HTML+CSS+JS) that makes use of the Enhanced WebRTC Javascript Library.
  * **Enhanced WebRTC Javascript Library** - The actual library which defines the `Phone` and `ATT.rtc` objects:
    * `Phone` - Call and Conference management.
    * `ATT.rtc` - Various configuration and utility methods necessary to setup the library.
    * `ATT.rtc.dhs` - Various methods specific for interaction with the Node DHS mentioned above.
  * **Updated documentation** - Documentation reflects the changes described above.
